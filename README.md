# beancount-fava-starter

---

[Readme in Chinese / 中文说明](README-zhcn.md)

A starter repository to try fava / beancount.

See [awesome-beancount](https://github.com/siddhantgoel/awesome-beancount/) for introduction and other resources around [beancount / fava](https://github.com/beancount)

## Requirements

- MacOS / Linux / Unices: a recent installation with `bash` and `python3` is likely to be fine. Some distributions require `python3-venv` `python3-dev` or alike package.

- Windows (WSL2): Should work like a Linux Distribution

(If you have trouble running, issues/PRs are welcome)

## How to use

1. Download and extract this repository
2. Start fava process
    - in MacOS: you can just double click `fava` in Finder
    - in Linux / other Unices: in terminal emulator, cd into this repository and run `./fava`.
    - in Windows / WSL: good luck to figure out
3. Open fava web UI as instructed
4. If it works, browser should show a few example accounts and transactions. You can look around, or mangle `main.beancount` and add your own contents.

(if it doesn't work, something may went wrong during downloading packages)
